## Xenia Nikolenko

As a Quality Assurance Tester, I have been involved in several projects that required manual testing, regression testing, and API testing using tools such as Jira, Zephyr, Confluence, Postman, and Java Automation. I have also gained a high-level understanding of web API, REST, and relational databases, and I can write SQL queries to prepare and verify test data.
